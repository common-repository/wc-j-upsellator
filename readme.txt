== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do i need to enable something? =

In order to let *J Cart Upsell and Cross-sell for WooCommerce** work properly, be sure to enable the "Activate the Ajax add to cart buttons" in the  WooCommerce -> Settings -> Products tab

= Can i use the plugin without purchasing the premium version? =


Yes, you can use **J Cart Upsell and Cross-sell for WooCommerce** without purchasing the premium version.

= Can i have multiple upsells triggered by single product? =

You can choose between standard mode, stacked and carousel.

With the standard mode, only **one upsell at time** is offered to the customer. 
If the customer accepts that upsell, he will see the next one in the priority list.

However, you can play with the priority order of **J Cart Upsell and Cross-sell for WooCommerce**: an upsell by product list is stronger than one by category/attribute list that is stronger than one triggered by cart limit.

With **stacked** you can display how many upsells at the same time as you wish, stacked on eachother.

With **carousel**, all upsells are displayed at the same time trough a carousel.

= Is multilanguage compatible? =

Since version 3.0.0, J Cart Upsell and Cross-sell for WooCommerce is **compatible** with polylang. Be sure to have also the Polylang WooCommerce add-on installed.

= Does it works with Elementor or Divi? =

Yes, **J Cart Upsell and Cross-sell for WooCommerce** works fine with Elementor and Divi. If you are using the Elementor cart widget and you want to keep that widget because it looks cool, you need to add the **wc-j-upsellator-show-cart** class to it. This class will make that element able to trigger the modal cart.


Since 2 modal carts can't be both active at the same time, the modal cart of Elementor cart item will be disabled.


= What if my theme already has a modal cart? =

**J Cart Upsell and Cross-sell for WooCommerce** by default keeps your theme cart-fragments untouched so it will all works properly.

= Is it PHP 8.x compatible? =

Yes, it works perfectly with the new version of PHP.

= The subtotal is displayed without VAT. How can i fix? =

In the main options page, try to activate the "Cart total" option.

Contact me, maybe these features can be implemented directly into **J Cart Upsell and Cross-sell for WooCommerce**.
